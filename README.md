### Project Background
TBD

### Project Description
The Lane Management System must be capable of performing 3 major tasks during its standard operation. Firstly, it must utilize its LDWS feature to warn drivers who are leaving their lane. It must also utilize its LCS feature to alert drivers who are off-center in their lane. Additionally, it must utilize its LKS feature to intervene when the user is dangerously veering out of major road lanes. The system utilizes a set of cameras and image processing subsystems to only activate when necessary. The system will also be rigorously tested against edge cases. The system will be capable of withholding activation when no major problems arise, and it will be capable of alerting the user when major subsystems are unavailable. Lastly, it will not take control away from drivers that continue to take action against the activated LKS subsystem.
